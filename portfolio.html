                    HI......! I'm Mahtab Shah, From Pratapgarh, Uttar pradesh. I am purshuing a Bachelor of technology
                    in
                    Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of technology, Dhanbad. Founder of HCC Canva.
                </p>
                <p>

                    As a software developer i love
                    to finding novel
                    concept behind software technologies or related fields.
                    I developed a Web Application that allows users to manually create or draw HTML and CSS designs.
                    The application converts these manually drawn designs into fully functional HTML and CSS code,
                    streamlining the design-to-code process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When i am not coding, at that moment i love to write poetries. Stay updated with the latest in
                    coding, software development, and cutting-edge technology!
                </p>



                <p>I’m an enthusiastic software developer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering at IIT
                    Dhanbad. My journey into technology began with a fascination for problem-solving and creating
                    efficient solutions, leading me to develop expertise in programming languages like C++, C, and
                    Python.</p>

                <p>With certifications in Full Stack MERN development, I’ve built multiple web applications, including a
                    task management system, a weather app, and a platform similar to GeeksforGeeks for study resources.
                    Additionally, I’m experienced in frontend and backend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                    MongoDB, and MySQL.</p>

                <p>Through projects like a hostel food review site and a web-based sorting visualizer, I’ve deepened my
                    knowledge of data structures and algorithms, ensuring that my code is both optimized and scalable.
                    Currently, I’m working on an interactive educational platform combining games and animations to make
                    learning programming, JEE, and NEET topics engaging.</p>

                <p>In addition to my technical work, I enjoy exploring new challenges in 5G and 6G technologies,
                    enhancing my understanding of emerging innovations. My goal is to create meaningful, user-centered
                    applications that impact and inspire. Let's connect and build the future of technology together!</p>

                    <p>I developed CodeFlow, an intuitive, no-code web development platform designed to empower users to
                        build and customize responsive websites without writing a single line of code. Much like
                        Webflow, CodeFlow allows users to visually design their web pages with precision using
                        drag-and-drop elements, while automatically generating clean, optimized HTML and CSS code in the
                        background.

                        With CodeFlow, users can select from a library of pre-designed components, customize styles, and
                        arrange layouts effortlessly. Additionally, the platform supports real-time editing and preview
                        features, giving developers and designers immediate visual feedback on their creations. From
                        professional portfolios to complex multi-page websites, CodeFlow simplifies the process, making
                        web development accessible to both beginners and professionals.</p>
